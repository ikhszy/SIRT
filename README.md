## 🚀 What is this?

This is a lightweight, user-friendly admin panel built with love (and React, Node.js, and SQLite) to help local community leaders:
- Manage residents and households 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
- Keep track of income & expenses 💰
- Generate and print Surat Pengantar 📄🖨️
- Inventories handling 📦🗳
- Minimum chance of data-theft (as long as you're not putting the DB online) 🔒

Yes, it’s made for **real-world RT/RW** operations, but with the smoothness of a modern app.
